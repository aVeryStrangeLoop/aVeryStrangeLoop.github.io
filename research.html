						A population of single-celled or multi-cellular organisms under develop a range of emergent dynamics and characteristics as a result of the multi-scale nature of the system, with each scale having its own set of processes and mutable entities. This independent undergraduate thesis project was a breadth-first enquiry into the mechanism by which evolutionary processes lead to emergence of interesting characteristics in generalised computational models of such systems.

					<p class="projdesc">Modeling multicellular organisms as agent networks that can perform a fixed number of tasks, we developed biologically inspired utility functions (environment models) that lead to sharing of information between cells/agents when overall utility of the organism is optimised. These results have a natural parallel in evolution, and can also be extended to other problems such as long-term stability of organizations and administrative structures.

				<h3 class="rtitle">Cell-sorting under the Potts and Cellular Potts models (2019)</h3>
				<div class="projdescbox">
					<img class="projimg" src="assets/images/cpm_1.png">
					<p class="projdesc">The Potts model is a simple lattice based simulation of cell sorting with each site in the lattice denoting a single cell. An extended-Q (or cellular Potts) model takes this further and assumes extended cells, each covering more than one lattice sites. I implemented these two models in python and showed that the extended Potts model shows cell sorting at much higher temperatures than the normal model.

					<p class="projdesc">In 2018, I led the team from IISc at the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition. Our project, Phageshift, demonstrated a new paradigm of bacterial infection treatment using engineered phages that counter the problem of antibiotic resistance and endotoxin release, both of which are associated with modern-day antibiotics. I presented this project and our results at the Giant Jamboree in Boston, resulting in a Gold Medal and a nomination for the best software tool special prize.</p>

				<div class="projdescbox">
					<img class="projimg" src="assets/images/ift_2.png">
					<p class="projdesc">The goal of the 2017 iGEM project from IISc - iFloat - was to improve in vitro floatation of haloarcheal gas vesicles to aid their use in protein purification and other fields. This was done using a combination of synthetic biology constructs and chemical methods. Using a mathematical model, I demonstrated that it is impossible to use unclustered gas vesicles to achieve sufficient flotation when attached to a recombinant protein. This led to the formulation of the above problem. This project won us a gold medal at the Giant Jamboree in Boston.</p>

					<p class="projdesc" style="margin-left:0px;">During a short internship at the <a href="https://www.thutupallilab.com/">Thutupalli lab</a> (National Center for Biological Sciences, Bangalore), I learnt about active brownian motion and how it can give rise to order and phase transition like phenomena (motility induced phase separation). I also designed active brownian particles that can transduce energy from a vertically vibrating surface into horizontal active motion. (with Dr. Shashi Thutupalli, NCBS)</p>
