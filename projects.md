## Research

### Evolution across scales
Undergraduate thesis project

Advisor : Dr. Ramray Bhat, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
Duration: May 2019 - _ongoing_

Description: We are looking at how the evolution of multicellular body plans can be thought of as a process involving increase in complexity at multiple scales. This leads to certain non-trivial fitness dynamics at these scales (and an inter-scale tradeoff) that changes under different environmental conditions. 



### PhageShift - iGEM 2018
Team Lead

Advisors: Dr. Sandeep Eswarappa and Prof. Umesh Varshney, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
Duration: January 2018 - October 2018

Description: I led the 2018 team from IISc at the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition. Phageshift aimed to shift the paradigm of bacterial infection treatment using engineered phages that counter the problem of antibiotic resistance and endotoxin release, both of which are associated with modern day antibiotics.

### iFloat - iGEM 2017
Mathematical modeling lead

Advisors: Prof. Dipshikha Chakravortty and Prof. Rajan Dighe, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
Duration: April 2017 - November 2017

Description: The goal of iFloat was to improve _in vitro_ floatation of haloarcheal gas vesicles to aid their use in protein purification and other fields. This was done using a combination of synthetic biology constructs and chemical methods.

### Thutupalli Lab
Summer intern

Advisor: Dr. Shashi Thutupalli, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore.
Duration: May 2017 - July 2017

Description: Learnt about active brownian motion and how it can give rise to order and phase transition like phenomena (motility induced phase separation). Also designed active brownian particles that can transduce energy from a vertically vibrating surface into horizontal active motion.
