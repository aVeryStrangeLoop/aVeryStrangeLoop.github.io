## Research

### Evolution across scales
Undergraduate thesis project

Advisor : Dr. Ramray Bhat, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore

Duration: May 2019 - May 2020

Description: The environment and the ecological structure of a living system shape the rules under which evolution of the constituent agents takes place. A population of single-celled or multi-cellular organisms under such contexts develop a range of emergent dynamics and characteristics as a result of the multi-scale nature of the system, with each scale having its own set of processes and mutable entities. This work is a breadth-first enquiry into the mechanism by which evolutionary processes lead to emergence of interesting characteristics in generalised computational models of such systems.



### PhageShift - iGEM 2018
Team Lead

Advisors: Dr. Sandeep Eswarappa and Prof. Umesh Varshney, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore

Duration: January 2018 - October 2018

Description: I led the 2018 team from IISc at the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition. Phageshift aimed to shift the paradigm of bacterial infection treatment using engineered phages that counter the problem of antibiotic resistance and endotoxin release, both of which are associated with modern day antibiotics.

### iFloat - iGEM 2017
Mathematical modeling lead

Advisors: Prof. Dipshikha Chakravortty and Prof. Rajan Dighe, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore

Duration: April 2017 - November 2017

Description: The goal of iFloat was to improve _in vitro_ floatation of haloarcheal gas vesicles to aid their use in protein purification and other fields. This was done using a combination of synthetic biology constructs and chemical methods.

### Thutupalli Lab
Summer intern

Advisor: Dr. Shashi Thutupalli, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore

Duration: May 2017 - July 2017

Description: Learnt about active brownian motion and how it can give rise to order and phase transition like phenomena (motility induced phase separation). Also designed active brownian particles that can transduce energy from a vertically vibrating surface into horizontal active motion.
