# Brownian Particle in a fluctuating potential


## Flat Potential with reflecting boundaries in $x\in(-a,a)$

In the absence of a potential gradient, the drift speed of the Brownian particle is zero and the Fokker-Planck equation for its probability distribution is given by,

$$\frac{\partial p(x,t)}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial ^2p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$$ (1)

Let us assume that the particle starts out at $x=0$, this implies that the probability distribution $p(x,0)$ is given by,

$$p(x,0)=\delta (x)$$ (2)
