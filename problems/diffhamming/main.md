## Setup

Consider a fixed-size population consisting of $N$ organisms, each with a _genotype_ composed of $L$ sites that can be in one of two states&mdash;0 or 1. Let $k$ denote the number of $1$s present in a particular genome, and $n_k$ is the number of organisms in the population with $k$ $1$s in their genome.
