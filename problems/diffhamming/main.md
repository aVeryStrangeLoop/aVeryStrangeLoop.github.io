# Diffusion in Hamming space

**Author**: Bhaskar Kumawat

## Setup

Consider a fixed-size population consisting of $N$ organisms, each with a _genotype_ composed of $L$ sites that can be in one of two states&mdash;0 or 1. Let $k$ denote the number of $1$s present in a particular genome, and $n_k$ is the number of organisms in the population with $k$ $1$s in their genome. Thus,

$$N = \sum_k n_k$$ (1)

We define a quantity $k_{av}$ that tracks the average number of $1$s for genomes in the population. Thus,

$$k_{av} = \frac{\sum_k kn_k}{N}$$ (2)
