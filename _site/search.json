    "text": "This page contains links to the documentation for some of my projects that do not classify into the typical academic categories. Almost all of these are work-in-progress and are updated intermittently.\n\nEvolvability in 2-dimensions\nIn our paper on the evolution of evolvability in digital organisms, we found that populations localize on areas of the genotype space that lie on the boundary between phenotypes in a changing environment. The simulations here model a similar phenomena under a simpler Wright-Fisher population genetic model.\nGo to the project page\n\n\nBuilding the ZE3 macroscope\nThis project documents the construction of a macroscope, a fluorescence imaging platform that can take timelapse pictures of growing microbial cultures. This hardware is heavily inspired by previous work on imaging spatial dynamics in microbial communities. I am currently using this device to address questions on the evolution of evolvability in phage populations.\nGo to the project page\n\n\nEmbedded spatial simulations\nTiny, powerful, and cheap microcontrollers have become extremely abundant in the last few years. In order to learn how to program these devices, I am trying to create a small computer that can be used to simulate spatial biological processes (including spatial SIR models, population genetics, and models of speciation). I started out with a STM32 MCU but have recently switched to the RP2040 chip for this project.\nGo to the project page\n\n\nTheoretical Evolutionary Biology I: Mathematical Population Genetics\nThis is the website for a course designed to introduce theoretical ideas in population genetics to students from theoretical biology and physics backgrounds. Covered areas (tentative) include: Deterministic models of evolution, Wright-Fisher and Moran models with two alleles, infinitely many alleles, two and many loci, diffusion theory, the coalescent, and spatially structures populations.\nGo to the project page\n\n\nTheoretical Evolutionary Biology II: Modern Evolutionary Theory\nThis is the website for a course designed to introduce modern theories in the field of evolutionary biology to an audience adept to classical population genetics. Covered areas (tentative) include: Quasispecies and the error threshold, evolution on the genotype-phenotype map, clonal interference, robustness and evolvability.\nGo to the project page"

    "text": "Evolution of Evolvability\nEvolution can be immensely creative when it comes to the specification of organismal form and function. However, whether evolution through natural selection can sustain itself by improving the ability of a population to evolve has been the topic of a great debate. Surprisingly, the individual determinants of this evolvability (eg. genetic pleiotropy, development plasticity, mutation rate) have been shown to evolve under specific contexts. In my research, I am taking a step further down this line of reasoning to ask the following questions.\n\nCan the different determinants of evolvability evolve simulatenously under specific conditions? (preprint)\nCan we use tools from statistical physics to derive the conditions for the emergence of evolvability? (in progress)\nCan we use directed evolution to engineer populations with increased evolvability? (in progress)\n\n\n\nOrigins of Biological Complexity\nBiological systems are incredibly complex, both due to the number of entities that interact within and across scales, and the emergent phenomena that arise as a result. This complexity makes one wonder about the causal factors that can create such complex processes. In this context, I wish to understand the following.\n\nIs direct selection for complex features required for such complexity to evolve? (article)\nWhat makes simple agents cooperate and thus take the first step towards living in an ensemble? (article, poster)\n\n\n\nEngineering Living (and life-like) Systems\nOur ability to engineer living systems has increased substantially in the last few decades. I am interested in engineering biological (and biologically-inspired) systems to solve modern day problems. My questions in this direction can be stated as follows.\n\nCan we create engineered bacteriophages to improve the efficacy of traditional phage therapy? (PhageShift website)\nCan we use haloarcheal gas vesicles to improve the rate of production of recombinant protein products? (iFLOAT website)"

    "text": "Whether evolution through natural selection can improve the ability of a population to adapt quickly has been the topic of great debate in the field of evolutionary theory. The individual determinants of this rate of adaptation (eg. genetic pleiotropy, development plasticity, mutation rate) have been shown to evolve under specific contexts. The following questions probe this area further to ask,\n\nCan the different determinants of evolvability evolve simulatenously under specific conditions? (Cite: Avida paper) We find that under environments that switch between …\nCan we use statistical physics to model this emergence of evolvability in a changing environment? (Cite: Jordan work)\nCan we use directed evolution to evolve populations with escalated evolvability? (Cite: phage-bacteria evo.)\n\n\n\n\nBiological systems can be immensely complex, and this complexity is captured by the wide variety of emergent phenoeman observed in such systems (eg. ). I’m interested in understanding,\n\nIf biotic feedback is required for this complexity to evolve. (Cite: Alife paper)\nWhat makes a simpler organism want to form communities and increase in complexity? (Evolution of Metabolic Signaling in Multicellular Systems and Agential Networks)\nIf we can use essentially physical equivalents to model the emergence of this complexity (Cell-sorting under the Cellular Potts Model, Self-propelled particles and their dynamics)\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest advantage of studying life presents itself when we try to engineer living systems.
