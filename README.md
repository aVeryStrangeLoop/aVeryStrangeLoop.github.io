## About

I am a final year Undergraduate at the Indian Insitute of Science, Bangalore currently pursuing the four-year Bachelor of Science (Research) program. I am pursuing a biology major with eclectically chosen courses in other fields.

### Research Interests 

I am broadly interested in the study of living systems using theoretical tools from areas that come under the umbrella of complex systems - statistical physics, information theory, computation and dynamical systems - as well as computational methods to bring these ideas to life (quite literally). A brief idea of the kind of problems that interest me can be gathered from my [reading list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsCHwOlmCbUmnDI-eb9eIGUtDV80r0ON0A5dLFqniyU/edit?usp=sharing "Bhaskar's reading list") or previous work.
