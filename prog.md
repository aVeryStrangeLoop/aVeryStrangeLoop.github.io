## Open-source
This page lists the open-source programs I've worked on or am currently working on. All of the source code is available in the given repositories.

### Classical and Cellular Potts models
These two programs implement the classical Potts (a generalised version of the Ising model) and cellular Potts (extended spin areas) models under an easy, adaptable framework.

### evolNN (Under development)
A convolution neural network implementation to study evolvability of neural networks under different problem domains.

### Opt-agent-net
This program was written as a part of a project for the game theory course at IISc. It simulates a group of agents on a two dimensional grid. The bandits can execute a series of instructions to receive resources from the environment or share it with neighbours.  There is a global utility function that determines the utility of the agent based on its set of resources. In the project we showed that certain kinds of utility functions improve the extent of sharing when social welfare in the system is maximised.
