## Open-source
This page lists the open-source I've worked on or am currently working. All of the source code is available in on my github account.

### Multistate-ising solver (Under development)
A solver to find the lowest energy state of a 2D ising like system with each cell containing any number of states. The list of accessible states, a hamiltonian and system size etc is provided by the user. The solver then performs optimization over the system cells using multiple methods - Steepest descent, Simulated annealing and Genetic Algorithm.

### evolNN (Under development)
A convolution neural network implementation to study evolvability of neural networks under different problem domains.

### Opt-agent-net
This program was written as a part of a project for the game theory course at IISc. It simulates a group of agents on a two dimensional grid. The bandits can execute a series of instructions to receive resources from the environment or share it with neighbours.  There is a global utility function that determines the utility of the agent based on its set of resources. In the project we showed that certain kinds of utility functions improve the extent of sharing when social welfare in the system is maximised.

### Iris (Under development)
Iris is a generic physical processes engine that tries to mimic behaviour of entities with multiple degrees of freedom in order to observe how novel structures are created in nature. The goal is to reduce the known physical factors involved in evolution of molecular organisation to a very minimalist system that can possibly evolve some interesting processes.
