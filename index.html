		<div class="about">
			<p>I am currently a PhD student at the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb">Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology </a> at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I'm working with Dr. <a href="https://zeeelab.com/">Luis Zaman</a> in understanding how complexity evolves in living systems through coevolutionary feedback.</p>
	
			<p>More broadly, I'm interested in studying living systems using theoretical tools from areas under the umbrella of complex systems - <a href="#" class="tooltip">information theory<span>The study of storage and transfer of information between entities. Looking at life as a set of information processing systems has led to a great number of insights, specifically in evolutionary biology.</span></a>, <a href="#" class="tooltip">computation<span>The study of models of computation, algorithms, and their properties. Many seemingly "survival-of-the-fittest" phenomena in evolutionary biology are non-adaptive and rather a result of these properties manifesting in living systems.</span></a>, <a href="#" class="tooltip">dynamical systems<span>Systems in which a certain property evolves as a function of time. Even very simple models in dynamical systems show properties usually associated with more complex real phenomena.</span></a>, and <a href="#" class="tooltip">networks<span>Networks are composed of a set of entities (or nodes) interacting with each other (through edges). A network can be used to represent any generalized n-dimensional space (for example, the genotype space) and their properties are hence extremely useful in uncovering the effects of the structure of such an abstract space on procedural outcomes.</span></a>. My formal undergraduate training is in biology with special emphasis on molecular biology and systems theory. A significant fraction of my research till now has been either on engineering biological systems (synthetic biology) or studying their equivalents in artificial environments (artificial life).</p>

			<p>A broad idea of the problems that interest me can be gathered from my academic <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsCHwOlmCbUmnDI-eb9eIGUtDV80r0ON0A5dLFqniyU/edit?usp=sharing">reading list</a> or <a href="/research.html">research</a>. My free time is usually spent <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/55810171?shelf=read">reading</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kmwtbhaskar/films">watching movies</a>, or taking long walks.</p>
