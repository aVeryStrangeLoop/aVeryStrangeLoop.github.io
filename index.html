		<div class="about">
			<p>I am a master's degree student at the <a href="https://www.iisc.ac.in">Indian Institute of Science</a>, currently in the final year of the five-year BS/MS dual-degree program. I am pursuing a biology major with eclectically chosen courses in other fields.</p>
	
		
			<p>I am broadly interested in studying living systems using theoretical tools from areas under the umbrella of complex systems - <a href="#" class="tooltip">information theory<span>The study of storage and transfer of information between entities. Looking at life as a set of information processing systems has led to a great number of insights, specifically in evolutionary biology.</span></a>, <a href="#" class="tooltip">computation<span>The study of models of computation, algorithms, and their properties. Many seemingly "survival-of-the-fittest" phenomena in evolutionary biology are non-adaptive and rather a result of these properties manifesting in living systems.</span></a>, <a href="#" class="tooltip">dynamical systems<span>Systems in which a certain property evolves as a function of time. Even very simple models in dynamical systems show properties usually associated with more complex real phenomena.</span></a>, and <a href="#" class="tooltip">networks<span>Networks are composed of a set of entities (or nodes) interacting with each other (through edges). A network can be used to represent any generalized n-dimensional space (for example, the genotype space) and their properties are hence extremely useful in uncovering the effects of the structure of such an abstract space on procedural outcomes.</span></a>. My formal undergraduate training is in biology with special emphasis on molecular biology and systems theory. A significant fraction of my research till now has been either on engineering biological systems (synthetic biology) or studying their equivalents in artificial environments (artificial life).</p>

			<p>A broad idea of the problems that interest me can be gathered from my academic <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsCHwOlmCbUmnDI-eb9eIGUtDV80r0ON0A5dLFqniyU/edit?usp=sharing">reading list</a> or <a href="/research.html">research</a>. In brief, I am interested in designing and studying systems that exhibit large-scale behavior emerging from elementary processes at the microscale. I consider information, rather than atoms (or proteins) - as the <i>fundamental</i> in living systems - with biology being one instance of an information processing system over a chemical substrate. Due to this view, I am also extremely interested in studying generalized models of <a href="#" class="tooltip">substrate neutral processes<span>An algorithm or process whose outcome does not depend on the underlying system's physical properties but instead on how it switches between different states.</span></a> that are usually associated with living systems - like evolution (which can govern organisms, cultures, and even languages).</p>
			
			<p>My free time is usually spent <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/55810171?shelf=read">reading</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/kmwtbhaskar/films">watching movies</a>, or taking long walks.</p>
